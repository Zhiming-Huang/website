The project is maintained by Intelligent Information Lab at Northwestern Polytechnical University, supervised by [Prof.Yong Deng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8voeILsAAAAJ) and [Prof.Wen Jiang](http://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/jiangwen.html). The research mainly on fields of Evidence theory, Complexity Network, Fuzzy Set Theory, Bio-inspired AI, etc.

I joined this team in 2015.9. At first my research interests focus on processing multiple evaluations from experts and solve the confliction among opinions. Here is a published [paper](/publication/fuzzyfmea/) in *Soft Computing*. This paper proposed a method that allows experts give ambiguous evaluation and by combining different experts' opinons up, a defuzziation output can be achieved.

Later on I turned my interests towards Quantum Probability. The quantum probability attracts me in the field of analyzing the human behaviours in Prisoners Dillemma Game. Here is another [paper](/publication/quantumbeyesian/) demonstrating that a blief entropy based quantum Bayesian network explains the violation of *Sure Things Principle* in Prisoners Dillemma Game.

Also, I wrote a simple but robust D-S comination algorithm in Python. Click [here](https://github.com/Zhiming-Huang/Dempster-shafer-combination-rules) to view it.
