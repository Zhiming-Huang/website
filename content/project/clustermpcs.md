The project is maintained by [PanLab](http://panlab.cs.uvic.ca/) at University of Victoria, Canada, supervised by [Prof.Jianping Pan](http://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~pan/) and [Prof.Ruonan Zhang](http://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/rzhang). The research mainly on clustering multipath components in radio channel by applying methods from machine learning.

I had a 3-months research internship in Panlab, where I focus my work on how to improve the clustering performance of multipath components(MPCs) in radio channel. My first work is a modification to an existing clusering methods called Fuzzy C-means algorithm to enable it to fit in clustering MPCs situation. In this [work](/publication/clustermpcs/), I introduced a mapping function to make FCM compatible with MPCs situation.

Based on the modified FCM, I proposed a fusion technique to combine multiple snapshots to obtain a low-noise output. The framework and comparison results are in the [talk slides](/talk/interntalk/). I gained a lot through this internship and further build up my interests in research work.
