abstract = "Since the significant enhanced airport security impacts people' traveling, finding the way to maximize security while minimizing inconvenience to passengers has been a critical issue. Thus based on the given data sets, this paper presents a descriptive queuing network model which elegantly describes the flow of passengers through the security check point. Having considered the difference of Pre-Check and regular passengers, the model introduces Erlang distribution to accurately depict the different number of bins being scanned. After carefully analyzing the data sets, this paper makes effective modifications to optimize the throughput and reduce the waiting time remarkably. A steady and secure system is designed to accommodate the culture differences, making passengers more convenient and safe.In Task A, this paper developed a queuing network model which describes the flow of the passengers. The model creatively import Erlang Distribution to reflect the situation where one passenger has more than one bins to be scanned, which well demonstrates the difference between Pre-Check and Regular lane because the passengers in Pre-Check do not need to put off wearing and has less bins to be scanned.In Task B, some modification are implemented such as merging the procedure of Document Check into the procedure of Baggage and Body Screening to decrease the number of queues in system. With parallel processing the two procedures, the throughput and waiting time have been well optimized.In Task C, we make sensitivity analysis on how the parameters impact the average time each passenger take and the system throughput. Since different parts of the world share different culture, the model will be influenced by modifying the parameters. And sensitivity analysis indicates how important role each parameter plays.In Task D, comprehensive proposals are presented to improve the throughput while minimizing waiting time, including globally applicable suggestions and tailored for specific cultures suggestions.The model validation is implemented and the strengths and weaknesses of the model are analyzed to illustrate the model is effective and capable for Problemâ€™s demand."
