abstract = "Multipath Components (MPCs) are proved to be distributed as different groups known as clusters in radio channel. Since many advanced radio channel model have adopted the cluster concept, clustering MPCs becomes a critical process in radio channel modeling.Thus it is of great importance to cluster the large amount of MPCs automatically and accurately. In this paper, Fuzzy C-means  (FCM) algorithm, one of the methods that have once been introduced to group MPCs, is modified with a mapping function, which renders the algorithm converge to a better solution. Meanwhile, a new framework based on the modified FCM is proposed. Compared with the former FCM and KPowerMeans, the proposed framework is proved to have a better clustering performance and provides basis for further research."
