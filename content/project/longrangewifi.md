The project is maintained by wireless communication Lab at Northwestern Polytechnical University, supervised by [Prof.Ruonan Zhang](http://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/rzhang) and [Prof.Bin Li](http://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/2014010059.html). The project focuses on improving the communication distane between a Base Station (BS) on the ground and a Mobile Station(MS) on a Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle (UAV).

I joined this team in 2016.3. My job is to Conducted field experiment, Established and monitored the communication systems. The figure below shows the system we paid attention to.

The Internet provider links to UAV, who provides Internet access to the ground users whom it covers.

The improvement strategies are mainly for two parts. First is the communicaion protocals and the second is the antenna and tx powers. The team are now developing communication system based on Openwrt. I've done some prepare research on Openwrt and work out a tutorial to help people get quick access to Openwrt developing.

The tutorial now is only in Chinese, later will release English version. Click [Chapter 1](/PDF/Chapter1.pdf) and [Chapter2](/PDF/Chapter2.pdf) to download.
