# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Water is an indispensable resource for human well-being and other life-support systems. According to the anticipation, the water source tend to decrease rapid- ly. Various factors lead to the scarcity, including the climate change of the cli- mate, population increase, the increasing rate of personal consumption, indus- trial consumption and increasing pollution and so on. Facing the serious sit- uation, it is necessary for us to analyze the detailed and specific cause of the ever-serious water scarcity and propose an effective way to access more clean water.Based on SD(system dynamics) method, we develop a model to analyze the relationship between the water supply and demand of a region. Considering the comprehensive factors, the region’s water demand and the ability of provid- ing clean water are both well evaluated in our model. In this paper, Shangdong Province, China is chosen as the analyzed region. The reasons for its scarcity and the type of water scarcity are explained in detail. And then we anticipate Shangdong’s water situation by using the proposed SD model. A mass of po- tential factors is taken into account to enable the validation and effectiveness of the model. Through the model checks, the model shows good performance in simulating the rain water situation in a region. In the task 2, we introduce a method to discriminate the type of cause of water scarcity, And the cases in task 2 indicates the validity of the method. Connected with the realistic situation, an intervention plan is proposed and the corresponding impacts brought up are discussed. Using our model, the future situation with our intervention is ana- lyzed and anticipated. Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of our model are discussed."
